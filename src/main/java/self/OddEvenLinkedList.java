 * Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes.

 * You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space complexity and O(nodes) time complexity.
 * Note:
 * The relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
 * The first node is considered odd, the second node even and so on ...
